# AdaptiveBreakTimer
 
This was made in two afternoons by someone who is learning programming. It features lots of spaghetti, redundant code, confusing names, code that does nothing, global variables, and other things that professional developers might call "bad practice". I don't intend to update or maintain it once it's finished.

The "Set timer:" text box accepts one, two or three numbers separated by a space or another reasonable character of choice. One number represents hours, two represent hours and minutes, and three represent days, hours and minutes.

"Sleep until:" accepts [hours] or [hours] [minutes] and uses system time.
